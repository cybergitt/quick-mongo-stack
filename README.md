# Quick Mongo Stack
This is the Dockerized Mongo Database Server powered by Docker & Docker Compose

# Usage
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

after your Mongo service running, you can browse mongo-express at your alternative port for the mongo-express. I set the default port 8081 then I could browse to localhost:8081.
